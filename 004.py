            Largest palindrome product
            Problem 4

            A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
            The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
            9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

            Find the largest palindrome made from the
            product of two 3-digit numbers.
